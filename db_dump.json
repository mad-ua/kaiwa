A random sample of 2000 physicians were asked to take one baby aspirin per day while another random sample of 2000 physicians did not take an aspirin. After ten years, 1% of the physicians taking aspirin got colon cancer, and 5% of the physicians who did not take an aspirin got colon cancer. The authors of the study reported that that taking one baby aspirin per day reduces the incidence of colon cancer in men 50 and over by 80%. Is this research biased?
